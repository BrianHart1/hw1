      <p class="title1">Who We Serve</p>
      <p>Hartline provides wealth management services to a diverse and expanding client base. Our advisors have broad-based investment experience and are committed to serving our clients, including:</p>
      <p class="title2">Individual & Family Clients</p>
      <p>Hartline is dedicated to meeting the unique financial challenges faced by high-net-worth individuals and their families. We provide comprehensive family office services for wealthy families, their enterprises, and their charitable interests.</p>
      <p class="title2">Foundations & Institutional Clients</p>
      <p>Hartline had its roots in Investing for Institutions.  There are common themes, especially between Endowments and Foundations on the one hand and Individuals on the other.  Neither group has any corporate coffers they can go to when money is lost. This fact alone brings the risk profiles of the two into close harmony.</p>
